# About Wilkes & Liberty: Champions of Digital Sovereignty

In the spirit of John Wilkes' fearless pursuit of liberty against tyrannical authority, Wilkes & Liberty stands as the vanguard of digital independence. We forge solutions that liberate organizations from surveillance capitalism and authoritarian overreach.

## Our Revolutionary Mission

Like Wilkes' unwavering commitment to free expression and individual rights, we champion digital sovereignty in an age of unprecedented technological oppression. Every solution we create strengthens your ability to operate independently of surveillance networks and controlling authorities.

## The Liberty Manifesto

We reject the false choice between technological capability and personal freedom. Our mission is to prove that advanced digital solutions and complete privacy are not just compatible—they're inseparable components of true liberation.

### Core Principles
- **Digital Sovereignty**: Technology that answers only to you
- **Privacy by Design**: Solutions that protect rather than exploit
- **Operational Independence**: Systems that break rather than create dependencies
