# Defense: Sovereign Protection in a Hostile Digital World

Channeling Wilkes' defiant resistance against oppressive forces, we forge defense technologies that protect national sovereignty while preserving the liberties they're meant to defend. True security never requires sacrificing freedom.

## Digital Defense Liberation

### Sovereign Military Technology
Defense systems should strengthen national security without creating surveillance states that monitor their own citizens. We build military-grade protection that defends against external threats while preserving internal liberties.

### Revolutionary Defense Philosophy
Traditional defense technology creates dependencies on foreign suppliers, surveillance integrations, and backdoors that ultimately compromise the very security they promise. Our approach builds completely autonomous defense capabilities.

### Liberation-Focused Defense Solutions
- **Autonomous Defense Networks**: Military systems that operate independently of foreign infrastructure
- **Privacy-Preserving Intelligence**: Defense intelligence that protects operational security without surveilling citizens
- **Sovereign Weapons Systems**: Defense technology free from foreign dependencies and backdoors
- **Independent Command Architecture**: Military command systems that answer to no external authority

## The Defense Declaration of Independence

We reject defense solutions that create new vulnerabilities through foreign dependencies, surveillance integrations, and compromise backdoors. Our systems defend sovereignty while preserving the freedoms worth defending.
